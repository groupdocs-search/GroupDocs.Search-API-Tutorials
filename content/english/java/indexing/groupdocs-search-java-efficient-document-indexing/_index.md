```
## Implementation Guide
Now that we have our environment set up, let's explore the key features of GroupDocs.Search for Java.

### Feature 1: Creating an Index
#### Overview
Creating a search index is essential to enable document search capabilities. It involves defining a storage location where indexed data will reside.
```java
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;
// Create an index in the specified folder
Index index = new Index("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\AdvancedUsage\Indexing\DeleteIndexedPaths");
```
#### Explanation:
- **`Index(String indexPath)`**: Initializes an index at the given path, storing all indexed data.

### Feature 2: Adding Documents to the Index
#### Overview
After creating an index, add documents into it for future searches.
```java
// Add documents from specific folders into the index
documentPaths.forEach(path -> index.add(path)); // Flexibly add multiple document paths
```
#### Explanation:
- **`add(String folderPath)`**: Adds all files in the specified directory to the index, supporting multiple calls for different sets of documents.

### Feature 3: Retrieving Indexed Paths
#### Overview
Retrieving indexed paths confirms which documents have been successfully indexed.
```java
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;
// Retrieve and display paths of all indexed documents
String[] indexedPaths = index.getIndexedPaths();
for (String path : indexedPaths) {
    System.out.println(path);
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **`getIndexedPaths()`**: Returns an array of file paths that are currently indexed, useful for verifying the indexing process.

### Feature 4: Deleting Indexed Paths
#### Overview
Managing your index includes deleting paths when necessary to keep it up-to-date and relevant.
```java
import com.groupdocs.search.DeleteResult;
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;
import com.groupdocs.search.options.UpdateOptions;
// Delete specific paths from the index
DeleteResult deleteResult = index.delete(new String[] { "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\
