   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
You can also download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Search for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/search/java/).

#### Environment Setup
- Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed (Java 8 or later).
- Set up your IDE to support Maven projects.

#### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with Maven project management will be beneficial. If you're new to these concepts, consider exploring introductory resources to get started.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Search for Java

### Installation Information
To begin using GroupDocs.Search for Java in your project, follow the installation steps outlined above using Maven or download the latest version directly from the official releases page.

#### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial**: You can start with a free trial to explore the features of GroupDocs.Search.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license to test without evaluation limitations by visiting [GroupDocs Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a license from [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Initialize your project with GroupDocs.Search as follows:
```java
Configuration config = new Configuration();
// Set up basic configuration settings for your application.
```
This initialization step is crucial to ensure that all components function seamlessly within your search network.

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the process into manageable sections, each focusing on a specific feature of deploying and managing search network nodes.

### Feature 1: Configuration Setup
**Overview:** Setting up the configuration for your search network is the first step in deploying nodes. This setup involves specifying paths and ports critical for node deployment.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Define Base Path and Port
```java
String basePath = "/path/to/config";
int basePort = 8080;
```
##### Step 2: Configure Search Network
The `configureSearchNetwork` function prepares the configuration object necessary for deploying nodes.
```java
Configuration config = configureSearchNetwork(basePath, basePort);
```
- **Parameters:** The base path and port are used to locate resources and establish communication channels.
- **Return Value:** A configured `Configuration` object tailored to your deployment needs.

### Feature 2: Search Network Deployment
**Overview:** Deploying nodes is essential for scaling your search capabilities across different environments or segments of data.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Deploy Nodes
The `deploySearchNetwork` function initializes and returns an array of search network nodes.
```java
SearchNetworkNode[] nodes = deploySearchNetwork(basePath, basePort, config);
```
- **Parameters:** Base path, port, and configuration are used to determine the deployment environment.
- **Return Value:** An array containing initialized `SearchNetworkNodes`.

### Feature 3: Subscribing to Network Events
**Overview:** Monitoring your search network's activities is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and reliability.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Subscribe to Master Node Events
```java
subscribeToNodeEvents(nodes[0]); // Assuming the master node is at index 0.
```
- **Purpose:** This step ensures that you are notified of significant events or changes within your search network.

### Feature 4: Indexing Documents
**Overview:** Adding directories containing documents to be indexed allows for efficient data retrieval across your network.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Add Directories
```java
addDirectoriesToIndex(nodes[0]); // Use the master node for indexing.
```
- **Purpose:** Facilitates quick access and searchability of all documents within specified directories.

### Feature 5: Adding Attributes to Documents
**Overview:** Custom attributes enhance document metadata, making searches more flexible and informative.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Add an Attribute
```java
addAttribute(nodes[0], "documentKey123", "customAttribute");
```
- **Parameters:** Specify the node, document key, and attribute to be added.
- **Purpose:** Extends the search functionality by enriching documents with additional metadata.

### Feature 6: Retrieving Indexed Documents
**Overview:** Efficiently retrieve and list indexed documents to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Get Indexed Documents
```java
getIndexedDocuments(nodes[0]);
```
- **Purpose:** Verifies the successful indexing of all necessary documents within your search network.

### Feature 7: Closing Network Nodes
**Overview:** Properly closing nodes is crucial for resource management and preventing memory leaks.

#### Implementation Steps:
##### Step 1: Close All Nodes
```java
closeNodes(nodes);
```
- **Purpose:** Releases resources occupied by each node, ensuring a clean shutdown process.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where managing search network nodes with GroupDocs.Search for Java can be incredibly beneficial:
