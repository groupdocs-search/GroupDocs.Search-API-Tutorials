        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/search/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-search</artifactId>
        <version>25.4</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**
Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Search for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/search/java/).

### License Acquisition
To fully utilize GroupDocs.Search, you can obtain a temporary license or purchase one. Visit [GroupDocs's licensing page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for more information on how to acquire a free trial or full license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Let's initialize GroupDocs.Search in your Java application:

```java
import com.groupdocs.search.*;

public class SearchSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an index in the specified folder
        Index index = new Index("YOUR_INDEX_DIRECTORY");

        // Add documents to the index
        index.add("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we will walk you through configuring and deploying a search network using GroupDocs.Search for Java.

### Configure and Deploy Nodes
#### Overview
Deploying multiple nodes in your search architecture allows for distributed indexing and searching, enhancing performance and scalability. This guide demonstrates how to configure these nodes effectively.

#### Configuring the Network
Start by setting up your configuration with a base path and port:

```java
Configuration configuration = ConfiguringSearchNetwork.configure("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", 49136);
```

#### Deploying Nodes
Next, deploy the search network nodes using the configured settings:

```java
public static SearchNetworkNode[] deploy(String basePath, int basePort, Configuration configuration) {
    // Define timeouts for sending and receiving data over the network.
    int sendTimeout = 3000;
    int receiveTimeout = 3000;

    // Create and start three nodes that can run on separate servers or together.
    SearchNetworkNode node1 = new SearchNetworkNode(
        1,
        basePath + "Node1",
        new TcpSettings(basePort + 1, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout)
    );
    node1.start();

    SearchNetworkNode node2 = new SearchNetworkNode(
        2,
        basePath + "Node2",
        new TcpSettings(basePort + 2, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout)
    );
    node2.start();

    SearchNetworkNode node3 = new SearchNetworkNode(
        3,
        basePath + "Node3",
        new TcpSettings(basePort + 3, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout)
    );
    node3.start();

    // Create and configure the main configuration node.
    SearchNetworkNode node0 = new SearchNetworkNode(
        0,
        basePath + "Node0",
        new TcpSettings(basePort, sendTimeout, receiveTimeout),
        new ConsoleLogger(),
        configuration
    );

    // Add an event handler to notify when the configuration is complete.
    node0.getEvents().ConfigurationCompleted.add(new EventHandler() {
        @Override
        public void invoke(Object s, EventArgs e) {
            // Event handling logic here (e.g., logging)
        }
    });

    // Configure all nodes in the network using the main configuration node.
    node0.configureAllNodes();

    // Start the search network by launching all configured nodes.
    node0.start();

    // Return an array of all deployed nodes.
    return new SearchNetworkNode[] {node0, node1, node2, node3};
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that each node's directory is correctly specified and accessible.
- Verify network configurations, especially port settings to prevent conflicts.
- Monitor logs for any configuration errors or warnings.

## Practical Applications
