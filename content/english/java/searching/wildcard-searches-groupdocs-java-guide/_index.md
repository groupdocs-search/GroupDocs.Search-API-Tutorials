## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Text-Based Wildcard Search

This feature allows you to search text using wildcard patterns, making it versatile for various applications like document management systems or content retrieval engines.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Index

First, create an index in a specified folder and add your documents:

```java
String indexFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\AdvancedUsage\\Searching\\WildcardSearch\\QueryInTextForm";
String documentsFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
index.add(documentsFolder);
```

#### Step 2: Performing Searches

Use the following queries to search for patterns:

```java
// Search for words matching 'm???is'
String query1 = "m???is";
SearchResult result1 = index.search(query1); // Finds words like 'mauris', 'mollis'

// Search for words matching 'pri?(1~7)'
String query2 = "pri?(1~7)";
SearchResult result2 = index.search(query2); // Finds words like 'private', 'principles'
```

#### Explanation
- **`indexFolder`:** Directory where the search index is stored.
- **`documentsFolder`:** Location of documents to be indexed and searched.
- **`search()`:** Executes the query, returning results matching the wildcard pattern.

### Feature 2: Object-Based Wildcard Search

This approach uses `WordPattern` for more structured searches, providing greater flexibility in defining complex patterns.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Index

Similar to text-based search, set up your index:

```java
String indexFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\AdvancedUsage\\Searching\\WildcardSearch\\QueryInObjectForm";
Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
index.add(documentsFolder);
```

#### Step 2: Constructing WordPatterns

Define patterns using `WordPattern` and perform searches:

```java
// Create a WordPattern for 'm???is'
WordPattern pattern1 = new WordPattern();
pattern1.appendString("m");
pattern1.appendOneCharacterWildcard();
pattern1.appendOneCharacterWildcard();
pattern1.appendOneCharacterWildcard();
pattern1.appendString("is");

SearchQuery query1 = SearchQuery.createWordPatternQuery(pattern1);
SearchResult result1 = index.search(query1); // Finds words like 'mauris', 'mollis'

// Create a WordPattern for 'pri?(1~7)'
WordPattern pattern2 = new WordPattern();
pattern2.appendString("pri");
pattern2.appendWildcard(1, 7);

SearchQuery query2 = SearchQuery.createWordPatternQuery(pattern2);
SearchResult result2 = index.search(query2); // Finds words like 'private', 'principles'
```

#### Explanation
- **`WordPattern`:** Allows constructing complex search patterns.
- **`appendString()`, `appendOneCharacterWildcard()`, `appendWildcard(min, max)`:** Methods to build the pattern step-by-step.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Management:** Quickly locate documents based on partial text matches.
2. **Content Retrieval Engines:** Enhance search functionalities in CMS platforms.
3. **Data Mining:** Extract specific data patterns from large datasets efficiently.

## Performance Considerations

- **Index Optimization:** Regularly update and optimize your index for faster searches.
- **Memory Management:** Monitor Java memory usage to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Best Practices:** Use efficient wildcard patterns to minimize search time.

## Conclusion

By implementing GroupDocs.Search for Java's wildcard search features, you can significantly enhance the search capabilities of your applications. Whether using text-based or object-based approaches, these techniques offer flexibility and precision in handling complex search queries. Explore further by experimenting with different patterns and integrating these functionalities into larger projects. Try it out today to experience the power of advanced searches!
