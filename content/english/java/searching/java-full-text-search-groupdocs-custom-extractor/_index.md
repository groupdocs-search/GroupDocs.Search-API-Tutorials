# Master Full-Text Search in Java: Implement Custom Text Extractors with GroupDocs

Full-text search functionality is essential for applications that need to index and retrieve data from large document collections efficiently. This guide explores implementing full-text search using GroupDocs.Search for Java, focusing on creating an index with custom text extractors. By integrating this feature, you can customize the indexing process to suit your application's specific needs.

## What You'll Learn
- Set up and configure GroupDocs.Search for Java.
- Implement a custom text extractor for tailored indexing.
- Add documents to an index and perform searches efficiently.
- Apply full-text search in real-world scenarios.
- Optimize performance and memory management with GroupDocs.Search.

Ready to enhance your application's document handling capabilities? Let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before implementing, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries
Ensure you are using the correct version of GroupDocs.Search for Java by adding it as a dependency in your project. Here's how you can set it up with Maven:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/search/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-search</artifactId>
        <version>25.4</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Search for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/search/java/).

### Environment Setup
- Ensure your development environment is set up with JDK 8 or higher.
- Familiarity with Java programming and file handling concepts will be beneficial.

### License Acquisition
Start by downloading a free trial license to explore GroupDocs.Search features. For extended use, consider purchasing a full license or applying for a temporary one through [GroupDocs's website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Search for Java

To begin with GroupDocs.Search, initialize and configure it within your application:

1. **Maven Setup**: Ensure the Maven configuration is correctly added to your `pom.xml` as shown above.
2. **License Initialization**:
   - If using a trial or temporary license, load it before creating an index:
     ```java
     License license = new License();
     license.setLicense("path/to/license");
     ```

With the setup complete, let's move into implementing our custom text extractor.

## Implementation Guide

### Create Index with Custom Text Extractor

GroupDocs.Search allows you to create indexes tailored for specific file types using custom text extractors. Here’s how you can implement a custom text extractor:

#### Overview
This feature lets you define how text is extracted from your documents, offering flexibility beyond default extraction capabilities.

#### Steps to Implement

**Step 1: Define Custom Text Extractor**
Create a class that extends `TextExtractorBase`. This allows you to specify file types and the logic for extracting text.

```java
import com.groupdocs.search.extractors.TextExtractorBase;

public class LogExtractor extends TextExtractorBase {
    @Override
    public String[] getFileExtensions() {
        return new String[]{"log"};
    }

    @Override
    public String extractText(String documentContent) {
        // Custom logic for extracting text from log files.
        return documentContent; // Implement your custom extraction here.
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Configure Index Settings**
Add the custom extractor to your index settings:

```java
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;
import com.groupdocs.search.IndexSettings;

public class CustomTextExtractorFeature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String indexFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        IndexSettings settings = new IndexSettings();
        
        // Adding the custom text extractor to the settings.
        settings.getCustomExtractors().addItem(new LogExtractor());
        
        // Creating or loading an index with specified settings and enabling auto-reindexing.
        Index index = new Index(indexFolder, settings, true);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `getFileExtensions()` specifies which file types the extractor applies to.
- `extractText(String documentContent)` contains your logic for processing documents of that type.

### Add Documents to Index
After setting up your custom text extractor, add documents to the index:

```java
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;

public class AddDocumentsToIndexFeature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String indexFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        String documentsFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Loading or creating an index in the specified directory.
        Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
        
        // Adding documents from the folder to the index.
        index.add(documentsFolder);
    }
}
```

### Search Documents in Index
With your documents indexed, perform searches using specific queries:

```java
import com.groupdocs.search.Index;
import com.groupdocs.search.results.SearchResult;

public class SearchDocumentsFeature {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String indexFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Loading the existing index.
        Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
        
        // Define search queries
        String query1 = "objection";
        String query2 = "log";
        
        // Performing searches and retrieving results.
        SearchResult result1 = index.search(query1);
        SearchResult result2 = index.search(query2);
    }
}
```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Search can be applied in various scenarios, including:
- **Log Management**: Efficiently search through vast log files to identify errors or specific events.
- **Document Retrieval Systems**: Quickly locate documents within large repositories based on content.
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze text data for patterns or anomalies.

## Performance Considerations
When using GroupDocs.Search, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- Use appropriate index settings tailored to your file types and storage capabilities.
- Regularly monitor and manage memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- Leverage auto-reindexing features to keep your search data up-to-date without manual intervention.
