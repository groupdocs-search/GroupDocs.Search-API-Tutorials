- Visual Studio installed to create and manage your project.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with file handling in .NET applications.

## Setting Up GroupDocs for .NET
Start by installing the necessary packages:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Viewer
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**: Search for "GroupDocs.Viewer" and "GroupDocs.Redaction" to install the latest versions.

### License Acquisition Steps
Start with a free trial by downloading the packages, allowing you to explore their functionalities. For extended use, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing a full license from GroupDocs.

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down implementation into key features:
1. Initializing and setting up the viewer.
2. Rendering documents as HTML pages.
3. Integrating redaction capabilities.

### Initialize Viewer for Document Processing
#### Overview
Initializing the viewer is your first step towards processing documents, involving creating a cache directory and setting up load options for password-protected documents.
**Step-by-Step Implementation**
1. **Create Cache Directory**: Ensure there's a folder to store processed files.
   ```csharp
   Directory.CreateDirectory("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
   ```
2. **Set Up Load Options**: Configure with passwords for protected documents.
   ```csharp
   LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions { Password = password };
   ```
3. **Initialize Viewer Object**:
   ```csharp
   using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(documentPath, loadOptions))
   {
       // Placeholder for further actions.
   }
   ```
### Generate HTML View Options
#### Overview
Configuring the view options determines how documents are rendered as HTML pages, including handling resources like images.
**Step-by-Step Implementation**
1. **Define File Paths**: Use functions to specify paths for HTML pages and resources.
   ```csharp
   Func<int, FileStream> htmlPageFilePath = pageNumber =>
   {
       string cacheFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", $"page_{pageNumber}.html");
       return File.Create(cacheFilePath);
   };
   ```
2. **Configure Resource Paths and URLs**:
   ```csharp
   Func<int, Resource, FileStream> htmlPageResourceFilePath = (pageNumber, resource) =>
   {
       string cacheFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", $"page_{pageNumber}", resource.FileName);
       return File.Create(cacheFilePath);
   };
   
   Func<int, Resource, string> htmlPageResourceUrl = (pageNumber, resource) =>
   {
       return $"/path/to/resources/page_{pageNumber}/{resource.FileName}";
   };
   ```
3. **Create HTML View Options**:
   ```csharp
   HtmlViewOptions htmlViewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.ForExternalResources(
       htmlPageFilePath,
       htmlPageResourceFilePath,
       htmlPageResourceUrl);

   // Additional configurations for spreadsheets.
   htmlViewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions = SpreadsheetOptions.ForOnePagePerSheet();
   htmlViewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions.TextOverflowMode = TextOverflowMode.HideText;
   htmlViewOptions.SpreadsheetOptions.RenderGridLines = true;
   ```
### Render Document Pages to Cache
#### Overview
Rendering pages involves processing each document page individually and saving them as cache files.
**Step-by-Step Implementation**
1. **Initialize Viewer**: Set up with the necessary path and load options.
   ```csharp
   using (_viewer = new Viewer(documentPath, new LoadOptions { Password = password }))
   {
       _viewOptions = new HtmlViewOptions();
       
       for (int pageNumber = 1; ; pageNumber++)
       {
           try
           {
               _viewer.View(_viewOptions, pageNumber);
           }
           catch (Exception)
           {
               break;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
### Integrate GroupDocs.Redaction
#### Overview
With the document rendered as HTML, apply redactions to sensitive information using GroupDocs.Redaction.
**Step-by-Step Implementation**
1. **Initialize Redactor**: Load your document into a redaction context.
   ```csharp
   using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(documentPath))
   {
       // Define and apply redaction rules.
   }
   ```
2. **Apply Redactions**:
   - Identify sensitive information patterns or specific text to redact.
   - Apply methods like `ExactPhraseRedaction` for precise control.
3. **Save Redacted Document**: Ensure changes are saved securely after applying redactions.

## Practical Applications
1. **Legal Documentation**: Automatically redact personal identifiers in legal contracts before sharing externally.
2. **Financial Reports**: Securely render and share financial reports, ensuring sensitive data is obscured.
3. **Healthcare Records**: Maintain patient confidentiality by redacting specific information when documents are shared electronically.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize rendering by limiting the number of pages processed at once.
- Manage memory usage effectively by disposing resources promptly after use.
- Utilize caching strategies to improve load times for frequently accessed documents.

## Conclusion
This guide detailed setting up GroupDocs.Viewer and Redaction for .NET, allowing you to render documents as HTML and securely redact sensitive information. Integrating these tools enhances the accessibility and security of document handling processes.

### Next Steps
- Experiment with different configuration options to tailor the viewer to specific needs.
- Explore advanced redaction techniques offered by GroupDocs.Redaction.
