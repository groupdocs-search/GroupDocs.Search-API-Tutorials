# Implementing Custom Exception Handling & Word Management in Phrases with GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

**Master custom exception handling and word management in .NET phrases using GroupDocs.Redaction for improved text processing.**

## Introduction

In software development, managing exceptions and processing text data are crucial for application reliability and performance. This tutorial guides you through implementing custom exception handling and word management in .NET using GroupDocs.Redaction.

By the end of this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Implement custom exceptions for phrase validation.
- Manage words found in phrases effectively.
- Integrate these functionalities with GroupDocs.Redaction for enhanced text processing capabilities.

Let's set up our environment and review prerequisites before diving into implementation!

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following requirements met:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **.NET SDK**: .NET 5.0 or later.
- **GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET**: Essential library for this tutorial.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 or later with .NET development workload installed.
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming concepts.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with exception handling in C#.
- Basic knowledge of working with arrays and collections in .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

To begin, install the GroupDocs.Redaction library:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Redaction" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to evaluate features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need extended access during development.
- **Purchase**: Purchase a full license for production use. Visit [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/) for more details.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;

public class RedactionSetup
{
    public static void InitializeRedaction()
    {
        // Load a document to apply redactions.
        using (var editor = new Editor("sample.docx"))
        {
            var options = new RedactorSettings();
            // Apply redactions as needed with your logic here.
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll cover two main features: Custom Exception Handling and Word Management.

### Feature 1: Custom Exception Handling

Ensure phrases meet a specific word count requirement, throwing an exception if not met.

#### Step 1: Define the Custom Exception Class

Create a class to handle exceptions when a phrase doesnâ€™t meet criteria:

```csharp
using System;

public class PhraseFirstWordFinderException : ArgumentException
{
    public const string AnyWordWildcard = "*";

    private readonly string[] phrase;

    public PhraseFirstWordFinderException(string[] phrase)
    {
        // Throw an exception if the phrase has fewer than two words.
        if (phrase.Length < 2)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("The phrase must be at least 2 characters long.");
        }

        this.phrase = phrase;
    }
}
```

**Why This Approach?**
- **Validation**: Ensures phrases have sufficient length, preventing runtime errors later in processing.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful feedback when invalid input is detected.

### Feature 2: Handling Found Words in a Phrase

Process words found within a phrase, focusing on the subsequent word after the first one.

#### Step 1: Initialize Word Finder Logic

Set up your class to handle the next word found:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class HandleWordFoundFeature
{
    private readonly string[] phrase;

    public HandleWordFoundFeature(string[] phrase)
    {
        this.phrase = phrase;
    }

    public void HandleNextWord()
    {
        const int nextWordIndex = 1; // Index of the word to process after the first.
        var nextWord = phrase[nextWordIndex];

        var foundWord = new { Node = "TextNode\
