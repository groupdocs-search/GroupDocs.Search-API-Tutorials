# How to Configure a .NET Search Network Using GroupDocs.Search and Redaction

## Introduction

In today’s data-driven world, efficiently managing and searching through vast volumes of documents is crucial for businesses across industries. This tutorial simplifies the process by guiding you on how to configure and deploy a scalable search network using GroupDocs.Search for .NET alongside GroupDocs.Redaction. By leveraging these tools, you can seamlessly integrate and enhance efficient document searching capabilities.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and configure a search network in .NET
- Deploying network nodes for distributed searching
- Subscribing to node events for real-time updates
- Adding directories for indexing documents
- Performing text searches across the network

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries:** GroupDocs.Search and GroupDocs.Redaction .NET packages installed in your project.
- **Environment Setup:** A development environment with either the .NET Framework or .NET Core is necessary.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with document management systems will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Redaction, you need to install it into your project. Here’s how:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
Search for "GroupDocs.Redaction" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To unlock full features, obtain a temporary or permanent license. Start by downloading a free trial from their website to explore functionalities without limitations during the evaluation period.

### Basic Initialization

Initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;

// Initialize Redactor with a document path
var redactor = new Redactor("your-document-path.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide

We will break down each feature of configuring and deploying the search network into detailed steps.

### Configure Search Network

Set up your base configuration using a specified directory and port for effective communication across all nodes in the network.

#### Steps:
**1. Set Base Port and Path**
```csharp
int basePort = 49104; // Ensure this port is free on your system
string basePath = $"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Scaling/DeletingDocuments/";
```

**2. Configure Search Network**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Search.Scaling.Configuring;

Configuration configuration = ConfiguringSearchNetwork.Configure(basePath, basePort);
// This method sets up the initial search network using the provided path and port.
```

### Deploy Search Network Nodes

Deploy nodes to handle larger volumes of data by distributing tasks across multiple servers or instances.

#### Steps:
**1. Initialize Deployment**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Search.Scaling;

SearchNetworkNode[] nodes = SearchNetworkDeployment.Deploy(basePath, basePort, configuration);
// This creates and configures search network nodes based on your setup.
```

**2. Identify Master Node**
```csharp
SearchNetworkNode masterNode = nodes[0];
// The first node is typically designated as the master for coordination purposes.
```

### Subscribe to Network Node Events

To maintain real-time updates across your system, subscribe to events from network nodes.

#### Steps:
**1. Subscribing to Events**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Search.Scaling;

SearchNetworkNodeEvents.Subscribe(masterNode);
// This subscribes to various node events for live updates.
```

### Add Directories for Indexing

Index your documents by adding directories, making them searchable within the network.

#### Steps:
**1. Define Document Path**
```csharp
string documentsPath = Path.Combine(basePath, "Documents");
```

**2. Add Directories for Indexing**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Search.Scaling;
using System.IO;

IndexingDocuments.AddDirectories(masterNode, documentsPath);
// This adds specified directories to the master node's indexing queue.
```

### Search in Network

Leverage distributed searching by querying all indexed documents within your search network.

#### Steps:
**1. Conduct Text Search**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Search.Scaling;

TextSearchInNetwork.SearchAll(masterNode, "nulla");
// Searches for the term 'nulla' across all nodes.
```

## Practical Applications

Integrate this setup into various scenarios:
- **Document Management Systems:** Enhance search capabilities in enterprise environments where document retrieval is frequent and time-sensitive.
- **Content Discovery Platforms:** Improve user experience by allowing fast content searches over large datasets.
- **Legal Firms:** Quickly find relevant documents during case research.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider:
- Regularly monitoring resource usage to prevent bottlenecks.
- Distributing nodes across different servers or instances to balance load.
- Implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
