# Mastering Case-Sensitive Word Matching with GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

## Introduction

Are you seeking solutions for accurate character-by-character word matching while respecting case sensitivity or insensitivity? You're not alone. Many applications, particularly those involving text processing and redaction, require precise word matching. This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET to achieve this goal.

What You'll Learn:
- Implementing character-by-character word matching with options for case sensitivity.
- Integrating GroupDocs.Redaction for advanced document handling in .NET applications.
- Efficiently processing text nodes using custom classes and methods.

Before we dive into the implementation, let's ensure you have all the prerequisites covered.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial effectively, make sure you meet the following requirements:

- **Libraries & Dependencies**: You'll need GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET installed in your project. This can be done using NuGet or other package managers.
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure your development environment supports .NET applications (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with C# and basic object-oriented programming concepts would be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

GroupDocs.Redaction is a powerful library that allows seamless document handling in various formats. Here’s how to set it up:

### Installation Instructions

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Redaction" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To start with a fully functional trial, obtain a temporary license from [GroupDocs’ official site](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/). For full access without limitations, consider purchasing a permanent license to unlock all features for your projects.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initializing GroupDocs.Redaction is straightforward:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;

// Initialize Redactor with the file path
Redactor redactor = new Redactor("sample.docx");

// Apply redactions or other operations here

redactor.Dispose();
```

## Implementation Guide

Let’s break down the implementation into logical sections to build a feature for case-sensitive word matching.

### Feature Overview: Case-Sensitive Word Matching

This feature involves matching words character by character, with options for strict case sensitivity or insensitivity. This is crucial in applications where precise text processing and redaction are required.

#### Step 1: Define Character Holder Class

The `CharacterHolder` class simulates necessary operations on characters:

```csharp
class CharacterHolder
{
    public char Character { get; set; }
    public char UpperCaseCharacter => char.ToUpperInvariant(Character);
    public bool IsSeparator => char.IsWhiteSpace(Character);

    // Placeholder methods for demonstration
    public bool NewNode => false;
    public object TextNode => new object();
    public int TextNodeCharacterIndex => 0;
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement FoundWord Class

The `FoundWord` class represents a found word instance:

```csharp
class FoundWord
{
    public FoundWord(object textNode, int textNodeCharacterIndex, int wordLength, bool isSeparator)
    {
        // Constructor logic here
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create ISuperFinder Interface

The `ISuperFinder` interface provides methods for handling found words:

```csharp
class ISuperFinder
{
    public CharacterHolder CharacterHolder { get; set; } = new CharacterHolder();
    public bool IsCaseSensitive => true;

    public void Remove(object obj) {}
    public void RemoveFoundWords(List<object> foundWords) {}
    public object AddFoundWord(FoundWord foundWord) => new object();
}
```

#### Step 4: Develop PhraseNextWordFinder Class

The main logic resides in the `PhraseNextWordFinder` class:

```csharp
public class PhraseNextWordFinder
{
    private string word;
    private ISuperFinder superFinder;
    private CharacterHolder characterHolder;
    private int wordIndex;
    private List<object> foundWords;
    private bool isCaseSensitive;
    private string originalWord;
    private string upperCaseWord;
    private int characterIndex = 0;

    public PhraseNextWordFinder(ISuperFinder superFinder, string[] phrase, int wordIndex, List<object> foundWords)
    {
        this.superFinder = superFinder;
        this.characterHolder = superFinder.CharacterHolder;
        this.word = phrase[wordIndex];
        this.wordIndex = wordIndex;
        this.foundWords = foundWords;
        this.isCaseSensitive = superFinder.IsCaseSensitive;
        this.originalWord = word;
        this.upperCaseWord = word.ToUpperInvariant();
    }

    public void HandleCharacter()
    {
        char character = characterHolder.Character;
        char upperCaseCharacter = characterHolder.UpperCaseCharacter;
        bool isSeparator = characterHolder.IsSeparator;

        bool isMatch = isCaseSensitive ?
            character == originalWord[characterIndex] :
            upperCaseCharacter == upperCaseWord[characterIndex];

        if (isMatch)
        {
            if (characterIndex == 0 && (characterHolder.NewNode || isSeparator))
            {
                characterIndex++;
                object textNode = characterHolder.TextNode;
                int textNodeCharacterIndex = characterHolder.TextNodeCharacterIndex;
            }
            else
            {
                characterIndex++;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            if (character != originalWord[0])
            {
                characterIndex = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where this feature can be invaluable:

1. **Document Redaction**: Automatically redact sensitive information in documents while respecting the case of words.
2. **Text Processing Tools**: Enhance text editors with advanced search and replace functionalities that respect word casing.
3. **Data Anonymization**: Mask specific words or phrases in datasets for privacy compliance, ensuring precise matches.

## Performance Considerations

When implementing this feature, keep these performance tips in mind:

- Optimize character handling by reducing unnecessary object creations.
- Utilize efficient data structures for storing and retrieving text nodes.
- Regularly profile memory usage to avoid leaks, especially when dealing with large documents.

## Conclusion

You now have a robust understanding of how to implement case-sensitive word matching using GroupDocs.Redaction in .NET applications. This feature can significantly enhance your document processing capabilities by ensuring precise text handling.

As next steps, consider exploring further functionalities of GroupDocs.Redaction and integrating them into your projects for comprehensive document management solutions.
