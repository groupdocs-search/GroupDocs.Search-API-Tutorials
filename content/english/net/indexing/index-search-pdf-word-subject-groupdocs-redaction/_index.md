# How to Index & Search PDF/Word Documents by Subject with GroupDocs.Redaction in .NET

## Introduction

Efficiently managing and searching large volumes of documents based on their content or subject can be challenging. Whether organizing research papers, business documents, or a library of files, the right tool makes all the difference. **GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET** automates this process by indexing and searching PDF/Word documents by subjects.

In this guide, you'll learn:
- Defining and populating a dictionary with document subjects.
- Creating an index in a specified directory.
- Subscribing to events for adding additional fields during indexing.
- Adding documents to your index.
- Searching within the index by additional fields such as 'Subject.'

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that your development environment meets these requirements:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Search**: Essential for indexing and searching documents.
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+**: Ensure compatibility with the version you're using.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A working C# Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider, to write and execute your code.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with file handling in .NET applications.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET, install it into your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Using Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

Alternatively, use the NuGet Package Manager UI by searching for "GroupDocs.Redaction" and installing the latest version.

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial license to evaluate its features. For ongoing usage, consider obtaining a temporary or permanent license:
- **Free Trial**: Register on their website to get a 30-day trial.
- **Temporary License**: Request this for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Purchase a subscription for full access if satisfied with the trial.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your project, follow these steps:
1. Add `using GroupDocs.Redaction;` to your code file.
2. Initialize the Redactor object:
   ```csharp
   using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor("your-document-path"))
   {
       // Perform redaction operations here
   }
   ```

Now that you're set up, let's delve into implementing each feature of our indexing and searching system.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Define and Populate a Dictionary with Document Subjects

**Overview**: Create a dictionary to map document paths to their respective subjects for associating documents with searchable fields during indexing.

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Dictionary
Define your dictionary using `System.Collections.Generic` and specify the data type it will hold:
```csharp
dictionary<string, string> subjects = new Dictionary<string, string>();
```

#### Step 2: Populating the Dictionary
Use file paths to associate each document with its subject. Ensure you use absolute paths for consistency:
```csharp
subjects.Add(Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Lorem ipsum.pdf")), "Latin");
subjects.Add(Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "English.docx")), "English");
```
**Explanation**: The `Path.Combine` method constructs file paths by combining directory and file names. `Path.GetFullPath` ensures the path is absolute.

### Feature 2: Create an Index in a Specified Directory

**Overview**: Create an index to store document information for efficient searching.

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Step 1: Define the Output Directory
Determine where your index files will reside:
```csharp
string indexFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "IndexingAdditionalFields");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Index
Create an `Index` object, central to GroupDocs.Search functionality:
```csharp
Index index = new Index(indexFolder);
```
**Explanation**: The `indexFolder` serves as a storage location for all indexing data.

### Feature 3: Subscribe to the FileIndexing Event for Additional Fields

**Overview**: This step involves subscribing to an event that allows adding additional fields like 'Subject' during document indexing.

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Step 1: Set Up the Event Handler
Attach an event handler to the `FileIndexing` event:
```csharp
index.Events.FileIndexing += (sender, args) =>
{
    string subject;
    if (subjects.TryGetValue(args.DocumentFullPath.ToLowerInvariant(), out subject))
    {
        args.AdditionalFields = new DocumentField[]
        {
            new DocumentField("Subject", subject)
        };
    }
};
```
**Explanation**: This lambda function checks each document against the dictionary to assign additional fields dynamically.

### Feature 4: Add Documents to Index

**Overview**: After setting up your index and event handlers, add documents for indexing.

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Step 1: Specify Your Document Directory
Point to where your documents are located:
```csharp
string documentsFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Add Documents to the Index
Use the `Add` method of the `Index` object to include your documents:
```csharp
index.Add(documentsFolder);
```

### Feature 5: Search in the Index by Additional Fields

**Overview**: Finally, search through your indexed documents using additional fields like 'Subject.'

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Step 1: Define Your Query
Formulate a query to find documents based on their subjects:
```csharp
string query = "Subject: Latin";
```

#### Step 2: Execute the Search
Perform the search and handle results with `SearchResult`:
```csharp
SearchResult result = index.Search(query);
```
**Explanation**: The query targets the 'Subject' field, filtering documents accordingly.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET can be used in various real-world scenarios:
1. **Legal Document Management**: Automatically categorize and search through case files by subject.
2. **Academic Research**: Quickly find research papers or articles related to specific topics.
3. **Corporate Compliance**: Ensure sensitive information is indexed and searchable based on categories.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET, consider the following:
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage during indexing, especially with large datasets.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of unneeded objects promptly to prevent memory leaks.
- **Indexing Strategy**: Schedule indexing during low-demand periods to minimize system load.
